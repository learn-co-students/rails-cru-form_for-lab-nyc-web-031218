# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# j = Artist.create(name: 'John', bio: 'short little bio')
# a = Artist.create(name: 'Adam', bio: 'much longer bio')
# s = Artist.create(name: 'Sam', bio: 'bio's are for kids')
